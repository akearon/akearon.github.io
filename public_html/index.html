				<h3>Primary Series of Ashtanga Yoga</h3>
					<p> Ashtanga yoga is an ancient system of yoga postures that are performed in the same sequence as a way of creating a meditation in motion. The intent is for the practitioner to quiet the mind through a series of postures. The postures are performed in the same order with each practice. A specific breathing technique called Ujjayi breath is used. Each movement is connected with an inhale or exhale. Anyone can practice yoga. You do not have to be young or flexible. Yoga helps develop flexibility over time.
					</p>
					<p>The intention of Ashtanga yoga is for the yoga practitioner to use the breath as a way of focusing the mind in order for it to become clear. Over time, the movements of the practice become automatic. It is beneficial for the practitioner to not have to think about which posture is coming next in order to be fully present in the current one. Between each posture there is a transitional movement also known as a vinyasa. This is used to prepare for the next posture. A gazing point to fix the eyes is also used as a way of focusing the mind and increasing mental clarity. Yoga will help you:
