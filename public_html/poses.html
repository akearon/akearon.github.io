				<h3>Extended Triangle</h3>
				<p>Triangle Pose is the third yoga posture in Primary Series. To come into Triangle, you step out to the right on your mat with your feet three feet apart. Point your right foot toward the back of your mat, and the left foot to ninety degrees. The left foot should be grounded and the arch should be lifted.</p>
				
<p>Your body should be in one plane. My teacher says imagine you are a piece of toast in a toaster, and if you touch the edge of the toaster, you will be burnt toast. I have found it easier to maintain good alignment by engaging my abdominals and keeping lots of space between the ribs on both sides of my body. The Piriformis and Iliopsoas muscles increase in strength and flexibility in this pose.</p>

<p>Remember: it is more important to have good alignment than to be able to reach your big toe. Flexibility will come over time. The extended arm will also help to create length in this posture.</p>

<p>It is important to practice every posture bilaterally. In Ashtanga, this means that to transition to the posture on the left side, you simply pivot the feet. On the inhale turn the left foot toward the top of the mat and the right foot to ninety degrees. On the exhale, reach the left hand out as far as it will go and then allow it to rest on the inside of the leg or shin.</p>

				<h3>Headstand</h3>
				<p>Before attempting inversions, it is important to know your body well. It is also helpful to have practiced balance postures or balancing on some level so that you know where your center of gravity is. It is advantageous to have spent time upside down or partially upside down to learn where your body is in space when you do not know where your body is in space. It is beneficial to practice kicking one leg up as you hop on the other foot from Ardha Pincha Mayurasana (Dolphin Pose). This helps with finding your center of gravity and your body in space. The proprioceptive and vestibular systems greatly impact the availability of inversions.</p>

<p>The secret to going upside down is simple, if not easy. Here is the secret to a successful inversion: learn how to fall. When you are no longer afraid to fall, you can approach inversions with a childlike sense of curiosity and playfulness. The only way to learn where your balance is is to lose it. Play with the tipping point. Relax into a fall so you do not get hurt. Injury only occurs through indecision, so you must learn to commit. Tucking the chin to roll or landing in a backbend are options, so working up to those postures can be a starting point. Falling well is imperative to the learning process and it value cannot be overstated. As soon as you fall, do the inversion again, without thought or hesitation. Work up to doing it well three times in a row, even if you only stay up for a few breaths. This builds not only confidence but muscle memory, which is very important in inversions.</p>

				<img src="./images/warrior_two_pose.png" alt="Warrior Two Pose">
				<h3>Warrior Two</h3>
				<p>Warrior Two is a posture from the Primary Series of Ashtanga yoga. It is a common yoga pose and is practiced in most yoga classes.in Primary Series, Warrior Two is entered from Warrior One, and is practiced on the left side first.</p>

<p>The left foot should be facing the back of your mat, and the right foot should be at ninety degrees. The left heel should be on the same line as the arch of the right foot. The left knee should be directly over the left ankle. The arms should be long and strong, with the shoulder blades moving away from the ears and slightly toward each other. The gaze should be on the left middle finger.</p>

<p>I find this posture easier to align when I draw my abdomen toward the back leg and lift my torso up out of my hips.</p>

<p>To exit this pose, straighten the left knee, pivot the feet, and bend into the right knee and take it to the other side.</p>

				<img src="./images/side_angle_pose.png" alt="Side Angle Pose">
				<h3>Side Angle</h3>
<p>This is one of my most favorite postures, and I feel that it is misunderstood. I observe students abusing this posture all the time despite my best efforts as a teacher. The intention is to create both space and stability. It is meant to be both grounding and opening, which can be diminished by attempts to bind it. This posture is not a bound posture in the Ashtanga tradition.</p>

<p>Side Angle is the fifth posture in the First Series. It is entered from Tadasana (Mountian) pose. To do Side Angle pose, step out to the right and bring your feet three feet apart. Point your right toes toward the back of your mat and your left foot to ninety degrees. Bend into the right knee. The left arm can rest on the thigh or reach toward the wall over your left ear. The deepest expression is with the right hand on the ground beside the right foot. This posture is a lengthening posture. There should be plenty of space between the ribs on both sides of your body. To exit the posture, straighten the right knee and pivot the feet. Bend into the left knee and take the posture to the other side.</p>
