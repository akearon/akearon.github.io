				<h3>Master Class with David Swenson</h3>
				</div>			
					<p>David Swenson is generally regarded as best Ashtanga yoga teacher in the world. He travels all over the world to teach yoga teachers about Ashtanga yoga and how to better serve their students. I have been fortunate to study with David Swenson several times.
					
<p>He is an elite-level yogi, and he is very down-to-earth and approachable. He breaks yoga postures into manageable steps so any student can practice any posture, even if they cannot go to the deepest expression of the yoga pose. He is extremely intelligent and has a great sense of humor. I highly recommend taking a workshop with David Swenson if at all possible.</p>


<p>The best advice he gave was to practice yoga every day, even if you only stand on your yoga mat for one breath. He says: “With repetition the magic must arise.” He does not elaborate on what that magic is, but leaves it for students to explore themselves. In my experience the magic is a kind of grace that arises He does not elaborate on exactly what the magic is. In my experience, “magic” is a form of grace and stillness that can bubble up through Ujjayi breathing and moving meditatively. We create the space for grace through the practice. Grace has a quiet dignity and we may not access it each practice. David Swenson defines grace as “ultimate efficiency,” which is precisely what the Series allows and intends for us to create. Magic happens when the art of the soul melds with the science of the body. David Swenson also says, “There is no difference between physical yoga and spiritual yoga.” We are physical beings, and through yoga we can use our bodies to understand the world.</p>
