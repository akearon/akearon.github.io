				<h1>Meditation</h1>
				</div>

				<p>Yoga can be a meditation in motion itself, but often it is used as a tool to focus the mind
and calm the nervous system in preparation for meditation. Meditation has many benefits,
including: decreased anxiety, decreased stress, increased concentration, increased contentment,
and many social, emotional, and physical benefits. There have been many studies done recently
on the benefits of both yoga and meditation on health and wellness.</p>

				<p>Yoga and meditation have been practiced for centuries as a way to quiet the body and
mind in order to live a life of harmony with oneself, one’s community, and the word at large.
One of the aims of yoga is for the practitioner to embrace a non-harming lifestyle by making a
commitment to nonviolence. The benefits of yoga include increased awareness and decreased
reactive responses such as aggression in both words and deeds in response to negative stimuli.
Through techniques gained by practicing yoga and meditation, people can control emotions and
impulses. If more people practice yoga and meditation, there will be a measureable decrease in
violence in the world. This creates the space for personal transformation, which can then be
brought into the world as demonstrated by a decrease in violence toward oneself and others.
Humans can create a more peaceful world simply by practicing yoga and meditation daily.</p>

				<p>The Dalai Lama said, “If every eight-year- old is taught meditation, we will eliminate
violence from the world within one generation.” It is impossible to guess whether the Dalai
Lama truly believes this sentiment, or was trying to get people to pay attention and embrace a
more peaceful lifestyle, but there is significant evidence to suggest that violent tendencies can be
controlled simply through practicing yoga and meditation regularly.</p>

				<p>Several studies report findings on how a regular yoga and meditation practice improve
cognition. Meditation practice is typically twenty minutes once or twice a day. The length of
time is less significant than practicing daily. Conventional yoga wisdom says that consistent
yoga and meditation practice every day yields more significant results than a longer practice
once or twice a week (though there are more benefits to practicing less often than not practicing
at all). This is partly because people are creatures of habit and partly because exercising the brain
and exercising the body require similar dedication: doing a little every day proves more
beneficial in the long run than doing a lot occasionally.</p>
